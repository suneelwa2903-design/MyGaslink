# Session Summary — WI-055 — Driver Mobile Polish (2026-05-16)

Seven-part driver-mobile polish session. Investigation surfaced during WI-045 (driver smoke); fixes were bundled into one WI because they share root causes and test infrastructure.

**Outcome:** 353 → 365 API tests passing. All four packages typecheck clean. No DB migrations. No web changes.

## Branch state

- Branch: `feature/...vigorous-ardinghelli-7d9e65`
- API tests: **365/365** (`pnpm --filter @gaslink/api test`)
- Typecheck: clean (`pnpm -r typecheck`)
- New deps: `expo-file-system@^55.0.20`, `expo-sharing@^55.0.19`

## Investigation → solution map

| # | Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Trip tab always shows "No Active Trip" | Mobile calls `/drivers-vehicles/my-assignment`; API mounts at `/drivers/me/assignment` — 404 every time | URL fix on mobile; `/me/assignment` rewritten to also attach today's orders + items + customer |
| 2 | Vehicle Stock tab always empty | (a) Same URL mismatch (b) `vehicle_inventory` table is admin-managed static state, never written on dispatch | New `GET /drivers/me/trip-stock` endpoint derives cargo from `orders.findMany` for this driver today, aggregates per cylinder type |
| 3 | Delivery modal can't capture empties | `emptiesCollected` was always in DB + API schema + service; only the mobile UI hard-coded `0` | Per-item TextInputs (Delivered Qty + Empties Collected) seeded on modal open, validated `>= 0`, submitted via existing endpoint |
| 4 | Delivery date renders as `2026-05-16T00:00:00.000Z` | Mobile rendered raw API value | Added `formatDate(value)` helper in theme.ts using `Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-IN')` → `"16 May 2026"` |
| 5 | Android tab bar bleeds through delivery modal | `<Modal transparent>` without `presentationStyle="overFullScreen"` + `statusBarTranslucent` | Added both props |
| 6 | No EWB compliance UI on Trip page | Trip tab had zero EWB UI; admin trip-sheet endpoint role-gated to non-drivers | New `GET /drivers/me/trip-ewbs` + `GET /drivers/me/trip-sheet-pdf`. Mobile Compliance Docs section gated on `settings.gstMode !== 'disabled'`. PDF download via expo-file-system v55 `File/Paths` API + expo-sharing |
| 7 | Login feature cards horizontal, cramped | UX preference | Replaced horizontal `ScrollView` with vertical `View gap:8`. Logo section gets `marginTop: 60` and a modernised shadow on the login card |

Side-fixes folded in:
- AppHeader logo: `icon.png` (solid blue Expo placeholder) → `logo.png` (brand mascot).
- `ACCENT.red`: `#dc2626` → `#e11d1d` to match web `flame-500`.
- Removed redundant "Welcome back" / "Sign in to your account" on login page.
- Centralised `resolveDriverFromUser(userId, distributorId)` helper in `driversVehicles.ts` (used by 4 `/me/*` routes + earlier orders.ts scoping fix from WI-054).

## New endpoints

All driver-role-gated, distributor-scoped via the standard `authenticate → resolveDistributor → requireDistributor` chain at mount.

| Method | Path | Returns | GST-gated |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/drivers/me/assignment` | `DriverVehicleAssignment \| null` (with `orders[]` attached) | No |
| GET | `/api/drivers/me/trip-stock` | `{ items: TripStockItem[] }` aggregated per cylinder type | No |
| GET | `/api/drivers/me/trip-ewbs` | `{ items: EwbRow[] }` joined to `gst_documents` | Yes — returns `{ items: [] }` when `gst_mode='disabled'` |
| GET | `/api/drivers/me/trip-sheet-pdf` | PDF (`application/pdf`) | Yes — 404 when `gst_mode='disabled'` |

No DB migration. No schema change.

## Files changed (10)

### API
1. **[packages/api/src/routes/driversVehicles.ts](packages/api/src/routes/driversVehicles.ts)** — added `resolveDriverFromUser()` helper, rewrote `/me/assignment` to include orders, added `/me/trip-stock`, `/me/trip-ewbs`, `/me/trip-sheet-pdf`. Refactored existing `/me/vehicle-inventory` and `/me/cancelled-stock` to use the new helper (no behaviour change).

### Mobile
2. **[packages/mobile/app/(driver)/trip.tsx](packages/mobile/app/(driver)/trip.tsx)** — URL + method fix (`patch → put`), distributor settings query for `gstEnabled`, conditional EWB section, PDF download/share handler, NIC EWB Verify deep-link.
3. **[packages/mobile/app/(driver)/inventory.tsx](packages/mobile/app/(driver)/inventory.tsx)** — URL: `/drivers/me/trip-stock` + `/drivers/me/cancelled-stock`, new `TripStockItem` interface with envelope unwrap (anti-pattern #9).
4. **[packages/mobile/app/(driver)/orders.tsx](packages/mobile/app/(driver)/orders.tsx)** — `deliveryItems` state, per-item Delivered/Empties inputs in modal, `formatDate` import, `presentationStyle="overFullScreen"` + `statusBarTranslucent`, `handleConfirmFromModal` validation+submit.
5. **[packages/mobile/app/(auth)/login.tsx](packages/mobile/app/(auth)/login.tsx)** — vertical feature card stack, restyled toggle pill, removed "Welcome back" copy (also done in this branch's earlier pass — finalised here).
6. **[packages/mobile/src/theme.ts](packages/mobile/src/theme.ts)** — added `formatDate(value)` helper, updated `ACCENT.red` to flame-500 (also part of earlier pass).
7. **[packages/mobile/src/components/AppHeader.tsx](packages/mobile/src/components/AppHeader.tsx)** — `icon.png` → `logo.png`.
8. **[packages/mobile/package.json](packages/mobile/package.json)** — added `expo-file-system`, `expo-sharing`.

### Tests
9. **[packages/api/src/\_\_tests\_\_/driver-me-endpoints.test.ts](packages/api/src/__tests__/driver-me-endpoints.test.ts)** — NEW. 12 tests across `/me/assignment`, `/me/trip-stock`, `/me/trip-ewbs`, `/me/trip-sheet-pdf`. Fixtures isolated by synthetic phone band (9912200xxx), synthetic email domain (`@test-me-endpoints.local`), synthetic order numbers (TEST-ME-*), and a dist-002 GST-enabled fixture chain (user → driver → DVA → order → invoice → gst_documents with seeded `ewbNo='TESTEWB000001'`).

### Tracking
10. **[.session/tracking/work_items.json](.session/tracking/work_items.json)** — added WI-055 (`done`, blocks launch, depends on WI-045 + WI-054).

## Anti-pattern compliance

- **#5** (PDF download via shared axios): handler uses `api.get('/drivers/me/trip-sheet-pdf', { responseType: 'arraybuffer' })` — never raw `fetch()`. Auth header preserved.
- **#7** (TEST_DATE 2099-12-31 for time-sensitive fixtures): `/me/*` endpoints hardcode "today" by design (driver always sees current day), so fixtures here MUST use today. Isolation via synthetic phones (9912200xxx — outside the seed `9800000xx` band) + synthetic emails + TEST-ME-* identifiers; cleanup keyed on those so no real seed row can be touched.
- **#8** (cleanup matches service query scope): cleanup deletes `gst_documents` by `order.orderNumber IN [...]`, invoices by `invoiceNumber IN [...]`, DVAs by `driver.phone IN [...]` — same scope our fixture creates.
- **#9** (response envelope): every new list endpoint returns `{ items: [...] }`. Mobile types accordingly and unwraps with `?? []`.
- **#10** (live sandbox verification): the EWB list test seeds the `gst_documents` row directly rather than calling live WhiteBooks. The NIC integration itself is covered by `gst-preflight.test.ts` + `gst-trip-sheet.test.ts`. What this WI's tests prove is the *projection + scoping* — the same way `anti-pattern-guards.test.ts` proves wire-shape contracts without calling external services.
- **#11** (log both success + failure): no external-API calls touched in this WI. The existing whitebooksClient instrumentation continues to apply on the dispatch path.

## Known follow-ups (not blocking)

- **Inventory role's fleet tab** (`packages/mobile/app/(inventory)/fleet.tsx`) also calls `/drivers-vehicles` — same URL mismatch family. Out of scope for this WI; flag for WI-046 (Admin/Inventory mobile smoke).
- **Tab bar bleed verification on Android**: I added the two props but can't visually confirm. If it still bleeds, the fallback is the route-based modal refactor (`app/(driver)/orders/confirm/[id].tsx` with `presentation: 'modal'` in a parent Stack).
- **Trip-sheet PDF generation requires at least one EWB on the trip**. For single-order trips with GST enabled, the service falls back to a per-order EWB sheet (WI-038). For multi-order trips with no `tripSheetNo` (gencewb hasn't run yet), the service generates a fallback PDF. No code change needed; documented in the service.
- **Online docs link**: the NIC e-Way Bill lookup URL (`docs.ewaybillgst.gov.in/ewbnatval.aspx`) is the official public verification page. If NIC changes the URL we'll need to update `handleShareEwb` in trip.tsx.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm --filter @gaslink/api test
# 365/365 passing

pnpm -r typecheck
# clean across shared, api, web, mobile
```

To exercise on device:

1. Restart API: it must pick up the new route handlers in `driversVehicles.ts`.
2. Restart Metro with `--clear`: it must pick up `expo-file-system`/`expo-sharing` native modules + the new screen code.
3. Force-stop Expo Go on phone (Settings → Apps → Expo Go → Force stop), re-scan QR.
4. Log in as `raju@gasagency.com` / `Driver@123` (dist-001, GST disabled). Verify: Trip tab now shows today's DVA + orders; Vehicle Stock shows aggregated cylinder counts; no Compliance Docs section (GST disabled).
5. Log in as a dist-002 driver if seeded. Verify: Compliance Docs section appears; tap Download Trip Sheet → PDF arrives via share sheet; per-EWB Verify chip opens NIC public lookup in browser.
